# The ZFlash Tool

The ZFlash tool it's a project forked from the Raspberry Pi Imager that has as its main goal to provide an easy way to choose, fetch and flash EVE-OS images to removable devices.

The ZFlash tool is provided to community by Zededa Inc.

### Linux

#### Get dependencies

- Install the build dependencies (Debian used as an example):

```sh
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends build-essential cmake git libgnutls28-dev
```

#### Get the source

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/zededa/zflash
```

#### Build Qt

```sh
sudo ./build-qt.sh
```

This will build and install the version of Qt preferred for ZFlash into /opt/Qt/<version>. You must use `sudo` for the installation step to complete.

#### Build the AppImage

```sh
./create_appimage.sh
./ZFlash-*.AppImage
```

### Windows

#### Get dependencies

- Get the Qt online installer from: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
  - During installation, choose Qt 6.9 with Mingw64 64-bit toolchain.
- For building the installer, install Inno Setup scriptable install system: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
- Install Visual Studio Code (or a derivative) and the Qt Extension Pack.
- It is assumed you already have a valid code signing certificate, and the Windows 10 Kit (SDK) installed.

#### Building

Building ZFlash on Windows is best done with Visual Studio Code (or a derivative).

- Open Visual Studio Code, and select 'Clone repo'. Give it the git url of this project.
- Open the CMake plugin settings, and set the following Configure Args:
  - `-DQt6_ROOT=C:\Qt\6.9.0\mingw_64` - or the equivalent path you installed Qt 6.9 to.
  - `-DMINGW64_ROOT=C:\Qt\Tools\mingw1310_64` - or the equivalent path you installed mingw64 to.
  - `-DENABLE_INNO_INSTALLER=ON` - to enable the Inno Setup installer, rather than the legacy NSIS installer.
  - `-DIMAGER_SIGNED_APP=ON` - to enable code signing for redistribution.
- In the CMake plugin tab, ensure you have selected the `MinSizeRel` variant if you intend to distribute to others.
- In the CMake plugin tab, select the 'inno_installer' target, and build it
- Your resultant installer will be located in `%WORKSPACE%\build\installer`

### macOS

#### Get dependencies

- Get the Qt online installer from: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
  - During installation, choose Qt 6.9.
- Install Visual Studio Code (or a derivative), and the Qt Extension Pack.
- It is assumed you have an Apple developer subscription, and already have a "Developer ID" code signing certificate for distribution outside the Mac Store.

#### Building

Building ZFlash on Windows is best done with Visual Studio Code (or a derivative).

- Open Visual Studio Code, and select 'Clone repo'. Give it the git url of this project.
- Open the CMake plugin settings, and set the following Configure Args:
  - `-DQt6_ROOT=/opt/Qt6/6.9.0/gcc_arm64` - or the equivalent path you installed Qt 6.9 to.
  - `-DIMAGER_SIGNED_APP=ON` - to enable code signing.
  - `-DIMAGER_SIGNING_IDENTITY=$cn` - to specify the Developer ID Certificate Common Name.
  - `-DIMAGER_NOTARIZE_APP=ON` - to enable automatic notarization for distribution to others.
  - `-DIMAGER_NOTARIZE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=notarytool-password` - specify the name of the keychain item containing your Apple ID credentials for notarizing.
- In the CMake plugin tab, ensure you have selected the `MinSizeRel` variant if you intend to distribute to others.
- In the CMake plugin tab, select the 'zflash' target, and build it
- Your resultant DMG will be located at `$WORKSPACE\build\ZFlash Imager-$VERSION.dmg`

## Other notes

### Custom repository

If the application is started with "--repo [your own URL]" it will use a custom image repository.
So can simply create another 'start menu shortcut' to the application with that parameter to use the application with your own images.
